# Rainy Days - Cross-Course-Project

<img src="images/RainyDays-Website-Design.png">

## Description
This project marks my first experience with both web design and web coding. I have used HTML and CSS to construct the website's structure and style. Furthermore, I recently incorporated vanilla JavaScript to fetch dynamic data from an API. I have learned coding along the way in this project which has been valuable, but it is also reflected in the code. I have discovered repetitive code snippets that could have been improved, especially after reworking the original hardcoded part into JavaScript. In addition, I have used different methods in the different JavaScript files, which is a consequence of my continuous learning process. I will take these experiences with me to my next project and aim to be more consistent and improve the code even further.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

- Develop Foundational Web Development Skills: This project marks my first experience with web design and web coding, utilizing HTML and CSS to construct the website's structure and style, and incorporating vanilla JavaScript to fetch dynamic data from an API.
- Practical Coding Experience: Through this project, I have learned and applied coding skills, recognizing areas for improvement such as reducing repetitive code snippets and striving for consistency across different JavaScript files.
- Continuous Learning and Improvement: The project reflects my ongoing learning process, highlighting valuable lessons that I will carry forward to future projects, with a focus on writing cleaner, more efficient, and consistent code.
