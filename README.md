# Rainy Days - Cross-Course-Project
<img src="images/RD-Template.png">

The Rainy Days course assignment is a simple e-commerce website for selling clothing items made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description
This project marks my first experience with both web design and web coding. I have used HTML and CSS to construct the website's structure and style. Furthermore, I recently incorporated vanilla JavaScript to fetch dynamic data from an API. I have learned coding along the way in this project which has been valuable, but it is also reflected in the code. I have discovered repetitive code snippets that could have been improved, especially after reworking the original hardcoded part into JavaScript. In addition, I have used different methods in the different JavaScript files, which is a consequence of my continuous learning process. I will take these experiences with me to my next project and aim to be more consistent and improve the code even further.
